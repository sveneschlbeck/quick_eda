## Project description

A python package for Data Scientists, Students, ML Engineers and anyone who wants dataframe meta data without the trouble
of having to type in numerous commands.

## Installation

Use ``pip`` to install ``quick-eda`` by typing or copying the following command.
```python
pip install quick-eda
```

## License

This package is licensed under ``BSD Clause 3``.

## Example usage

Users of the package can import the individual modules from this package, for example:
```python
import quick-eda.df_eda
import quick-eda.column_eda
```

This loads the submodules ``quick-eda.df_eda`` and ``quick-eda.column_eda``.
They must be referenced with their full name.
```python
quick-eda.df_eda.df_eda(<df>)
quick-eda.column_eda.column_eda(<column_name>)
```

An alternative way of importing the submodules is:
```python
from quick-eda import df_eda
from quick-eda import column_eda
```

This also loads the submodules ``quick-eda.df_eda`` and ``quick-eda.column_eda``,
and makes them available without their prefix, so they can be used as follows:
```python
df_eda.df_eda(<df>)
column_eda.column_eda(<column_name>)
```

Yet another variation is to import the desired functions directly:
```python
from quick-eda.df_eda import df_eda
from quick-eda.column_eda import column_eda
```

Again, this loads the submodules, but makes them directly available:
```python
df_eda(<df>)
column_eda(<column_name>)
```

Imagine you have a dataframe called ``pets`` with the columns ``name``, ``age`` and ``color``.
You could then run statistics on both the entire dataframe or e.g. the column ``age`` with
```python
df_eda(pets)
column_eda(pets, "age")
```
